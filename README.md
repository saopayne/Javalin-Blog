# Javalin-Blog
This project shows creating lightweight REST API project with Javalin.io and implemented with Kotlin.

## A Lightweight REST API library
Javalin is a true micro Java REST API library and has no required external dependencies other than the embedded web-server. 
It has an optional dependency for Jackson, in order to provide out-of-the-box object mapping support (response.json(object)). 
To use this feature you need to have Jackson included as a dependency.
